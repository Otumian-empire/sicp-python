I read chapter 1 and some part of chapter 2, basically all were about procedures and data. Trying to implement some of these codes in python but at this time, writing a test along side it.

## Unit testing
To run the test, use the commands,
`python3 -m unittest discover test`

or copy and past the above line into a file, `run.sh` file and do `sudo chmod +x run.sh` and execute, `./run.sh`

## Alternative, using vscode
By testing Python in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing)

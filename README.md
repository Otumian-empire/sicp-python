# sicp-python
I read chapter 1 and some part of chapter 2, basically all were about procedures and data. Trying to implement some of these codes in python but at this time, writing a test along side it.

## Unit testing
To run the test, use the commands,
`python3 -m unittest discover test`

or copy and past the above line into a file, `run.sh` file and do `sudo chmod +x run.sh` and execute, `./run.sh`

## Alternative, using vscode
* Configure the testing framework, choose unittest.
* Choose the `test` as the directory containing the test
* Since all the test methods starts with `test`, `*test* Python Files conating the word 'test'`
